**About project**

I have implemented a pop-up window in this project, with some inputs, close and save buttons.
Also I added card button which creating a new element with two inputs such as name of the place and link to the image
This card can be deleted clicking bin button and liked.
By clicking on the image merging a pop-up with scaled picture.
